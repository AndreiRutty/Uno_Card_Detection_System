                    PROJECT OBJECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 The main goal of this project is to build a system that can read
 and identify UNO cards using computer vision and machine learning
 while using our own dataset.
 In our concept, the system is trained on the dataset of the cards
 that we collected and labelled. The trained model then uses a live
 camera to detect and identify UNO cards in real time.

            Code Execution and Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The following Python libraries were used:
- "torch", which is used for building and training the neural network
- "Torchvision" for loading and transforming datasets
- "opencv-python" for processing images and having access to the camera
- "pillow" for handling and manipulating images
- "numpy" for manipulating numerical operations
- " tkinter" for using GUI to make the user interface

INSTALLATION:

- Install all libraries globally using:
   pip install torch torchvision opencv-python Pillow numpy tkinter
